# code-quiz
The quiz was made by adding dynamic HTML elements for each question and answer. The changes were caused by selecting a button which represented one of the options 
for the answers to the question. When the button was pushed, the current question and answer options would be replaced with the next question and answer options.
There was also a timer on the screen which would decrease by 10 seconds if an incorrect answer was given. The goal is to finish with the highest remaining time.
Scores are kept in the local storage and are displayed when the quiz is over.
